# BiasNet: Mitigating Label Bias with Pretrained Models

## Overview
BiasNet is a deep learning project focused on addressing label bias in machine learning models using pretrained models and transfer learning techniques. By leveraging the power of large, diverse datasets and advanced neural network architectures, BiasNet helps mitigate biases and promote fairness in model predictions.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes pretrained models to extract robust features and improve generalization.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Implements techniques to detect and mitigate label bias in training datasets.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Allows for fine-tuning of pretrained models on custom datasets to adapt to specific tasks.
- **Data Augmentation:** Supports data augmentation to create balanced and diverse training datasets.

## Installation
To get started with BiasNet, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BiasNet.git
   cd BiasNet
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s how you can use BiasNet to mitigate label bias in your machine learning models:

1. **Load a Pretrained Model:**
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

   pretrained_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet')
   ```

2. **Freeze Layers:**
   ```python
   for layer in pretrained_model.layers:
       layer.trainable = False
   ```

3. **Add New Layers:**
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

   x = pretrained_model.output
   x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
   predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

   new_model = Model(inputs=pretrained_model.input, outputs=predictions)
   ```

4. **Compile and Train the Model:**
   ```python
   new_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
   new_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
   ```
